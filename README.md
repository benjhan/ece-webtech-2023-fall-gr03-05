## Introduction

Node.js is used in order to create a local web application. It will respond with Hello and a name depending of the url used to watch the application :
http://localhost:8080/hello/YourName : the application will great you with the sentance "Hello YourName" 

Express will help us creates a router as a module, loads a middleware function in it, defines some routes, and mounts the router module on a path in the main app :
1. http://localhost:8080/articles : Show all the articles in our database
2. http://localhost:8080/articles : Using Postman we can post a new article
3. http://localhost:8080/articles/:articleId : Show the article with the articleId we have entered
4. http://localhost:8080/articles/:articleId/comments : Get comments from a certain article with the articleId we have entered
5. http://localhost:8080/articles/:articleId/comments : Using Postman we can post a new comments on the articleId we have entered
6. http://localhost:8080/articles/:articleId/comments/:commentId : Find a certain comments from a certain article from their Id we have entered
